Part 2 Explanation:

2.1:
As you can see from the file gen_data.py, for each number 97 or 113 and each operation, I randomly chose two numbers from 1 to 1000 (0 is not a natural number) and did the prescribed arithmetic and mod operation. I then printed that data to the correct file in the expected format. I did this for 10000 lines for training, and 2000 each for validation and testing.
