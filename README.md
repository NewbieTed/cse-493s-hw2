**Homework 2**
Group Members: Nash Rickert, Yixuan Wang, Sidharth Rajagopal, Hady Fawal

Instructions:

The results for part 1 and 1.5 can be found in the part-1-submission branch.

Part 2.1 and 2.2 can be found in the part-2.2-submission branch.

2.3 and 2.4 can be found in part-2.3-submission and part-2.4-submission, respectively.

Each branch has instructions and results corresponding to the deliverables and questions for the respective part of the assignment. All these instructions are easily found in the README.md file in the proper branch.

Apologies for submitting a github link -- we genuinely thought it would be easier to access and navigate for the grader. E.g. all plots are available and descriptively labeled inside of a directory instead of individually copy-pasted somewhere.
