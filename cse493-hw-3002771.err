/home/c64c542/cse-493s-hw2/train.py:278: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
DeprecationWarning: 'source deactivate' is deprecated. Use 'conda deactivate'.
